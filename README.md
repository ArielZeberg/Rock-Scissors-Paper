# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python, where you can play against the computer. 
The game is fully contained within a single file, `Rock-Scissors-Paper.py`.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `Rock-Scissors-Paper.py`.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts:
   - Type `start` to begin the game.
   - Choose your move by typing:
     - `0` for Rock
     - `1` for Paper
     - `2` for Scissors
3. The game will display your choice, the computer's choice, and the result (win, lose, or draw).

## Game Rules

- **Rock** beats **Scissors**
- **Scissors** beat **Paper**
- **Paper** beats **Rock**
- If both the player and the computer select the same option, the game results in a draw.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay via the command line.
- ASCII art representation for each choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
- Input validation to handle invalid entries and prompt users accordingly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The script only uses Pythonâ€™s built-in modules (`random`), so no additional dependencies are required.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the `Rock-Scissors-Paper.py` file directly.
3. Run the game by executing the command:

   ```bash
   python Rock-Scissors-Paper.py
